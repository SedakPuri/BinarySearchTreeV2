# BinarySearchTreeV2
Another version of the binary search tree implemented this time in C++ using pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation (via destructors). 

A binary search tree is a container to store data in a "sorted tree" in a fashion that the lookup of an element can use the properties of binary search (more on this at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree!)...



Logrithmic Efficiency:

**-Add-> Expected O(log(n))    Worst Case O(n)**

**-Insert-> Expected O(log(n))     Worst Case O(n)**

**-Remove-> Expected O(log(n))    Worst Case O(n)**
