# BinarySearchTreeV2
Another version of the binary search tree implemented this time in C++ using pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation (via destructors). 

A binary search tree is a container to store data in a "sorted tree"

Logrithmic Efficiency
**Add-> Expected O(log(n))    Worst Case O(n)**
**Insert-> Expected O(log(n))     Worst Case O(n)**
**Remove-> Expected O(log(n))    Worst Case O(n)**
